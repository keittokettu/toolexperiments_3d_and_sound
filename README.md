# experiments in tool-research: 3d and sound

i came into this wanting to explore 3d stuff, and sound stuff.. and indeed i did! here are some findings:

## 3d bits
i started my explorations with KIRI Engine (https://www.kiriengine.app/), which offers a variety of tools; what interested me most was its photogrammetry-esque "Photo Scan" (https://www.kiriengine.app/features/photo-scan). i think it exists at a nice and crunky middle point in between photogrammetry and ai/intelligent guesswork as to what an object should look like in 3-dimensional space. 

i started straightforwardly with scanning real-life people, objects, and spaces...



but then took interest in how KIRI renders a space depicted in frames from a video, pulled either from my own records or from online sources:



## sound bits
a parallel interest of mine were sound and music-related toolsâ€“ i thought of it as a foil to how many visually oriented tools we had encountered in class and how those seemed to dominate the 'AI mainstream' (other than let's say voice cloning/generated speech tools). i mainly focused on tinkering with:
